Football Analyzer âš½ðŸŽ¥


Football Analyzer is an advanced video analysis tool that utilizes computer vision and deep learning techniques to break down football matches. It automates the detection and tracking of key elements, such as players, referees, and the ball, while mapping their movements and actions onto a tactical field. By combining object detection, team classification, and movement analysis, the project delivers meaningful insights for strategists, coaches, and analysts.

This project bridges the gap between raw football footage and actionable insights by enabling precise position tracking, speed estimation, and tactical visualization. Whether you're interested in player performance, team strategies, or ball possession dynamics, Football Analyzer provides the tools to transform raw data into valuable metrics.
